Let DFA $A$ be the DFA recognizing the regular language L.
We show that this DFA fulfills all properties necessary for $LL(1)$.
For any transition $(p, \alpha, q)$ the symbol $\alpha$ is a terminal symbol.
For any pair of outgoing transition $(p, \alpha, q)$ and $(p, \beta, q')$ the labels $\alpha$ and $\beta$ need to be different (since its a DFA).
With both these properties, a right-recursive regular grammar can be constructed that is in $LL(1)$, since only a single token of lookahead is necessary to recreate the behaviour of automaton $A$.
